   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   
    <ul>
        <li>flour for dusting</li> 
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent roll dough (such as PillsburyÂ®</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) tub cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pitted sour cherries, drained</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>ground cinnamon to taste</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <h3>Directions</h3> 

    <ol>
        <li>Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Unroll crescent dough and divide into triangles along the perforated lines.</li>
        <li>Spread each triangle with cream cheese.</li>
        <li>Drop 3 or 4 cherries on the wider portion of each crescent dough triangle. Carefully roll up each crescent, making sure the cherries stay tucked in. Fold down <br>the ends of each roll slightly so it forms a crescent shape.</li>
        <li>Spray the basket of the air fryer with non stick cooking spray spray. Carefully set the croissants into the basket.</li>
        <li>Set air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Air fry croissants until puffed up and lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Check to make sure croissants are not sticking to each other and that they are not <br>overly browned. Continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes longer, making sure they do not get too done.</li>
        <li>Transfer croissants to a plate and sprinkle with cinnamon.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
